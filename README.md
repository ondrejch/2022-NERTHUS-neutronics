The Nonproprietary Educative Reactor model with THorium and Uranium fuel Salts, or NERTHUS, is a model of a thermal spectrum molten salt reactor (MSR) written in Serpent 2 with an accompanying python API designed to make testing various fuel cycles simple. This repository contains the neutronics and fuel cycle scripts for the model. The accompanying system dynamics model for NERTHUS can be found [here](https://github.com/ondrejch/2021-NERTHUS-core)
