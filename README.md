# 2021-NERTHUS-system-dynamics
The Nonproprietary Educative Reactor model with THorium and Uranium fuel Salts, or NERTHUS, is a model of a thermal spectrum molten salt reactor (MSR) written in Serpent 2 with an accompanying python API designed to make testing various fuel cycles simple. This repository contains the neutronics and fuel cycle scripts for the model. The accompanying system dynamics model for NERTHUS can be found [here](https://github.com/ondrejch/2021-NERTHUS-core). 

## deck.py

The deck.py script contains the model for NERTHUS. It is designed to write and run the Serpent input, and easily obtain the results from each run.

#### Quick Start

An example of running the deck, and printing k<sub>eff</sub> with its error. 
```python
from deck import serpDeck

# run the deck, get the results, print k_eff and its error
nert = serpDeck()
nert.full_build_run()
nert.get_results()
print(f"k_eff = {nert.k[0]} Â± {nert.k[1]")
```

Running a depletion calculation starting with a FLiBe fuel salt and Refueling with a NaBe fuel salt.

```python
from deck import serpDeck

nert = serpDeck(fuel_salt='flibe', enr=0.02, refuel_salt='nabe', enr_ref=0.1, refuel=True)
nert.full_build_run()
```

```

While most variable are self explanatory, some need more detail to be used.
`self.burn_steps` is a list of lists where the first value of the internal lists are the number of times that step will be run, and the second value is the time-step of each run in days.
For example `self.burn_steps = [[10, 1], [5, 30]]` will run 10 one day burn-up steps, and 5 thirty day burn-up steps totaling a 160 day depletion.

`self.control_rods` is a dictionary with each key, value pair corresponding to a control rod.
When the value is 0, the control rod is removed.
When the value is 1, the control rod is inserted.
There is not yet support for partial insertion of control rods in the NERTHUS model.
